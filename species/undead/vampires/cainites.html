  <p align="justify"><b>Fledgling:</b> A newly embraced vampire that has yet to be introduced to kindred society or formally emancipated from their sire, they are not typically considered responsible for their own actions as they adapt to their new existences. This phase of a young vampire's life ends when their sire considers them ready to Cainite culture on their own. This phase may last years or even decades for some clans, but some abandon it all together, adopting a trial-by-fire mentality. The Sabbat, naturtally, take this concept to its extreme conclusion, often referring to them as "shovelheads", on account of their being buried after the embrace and forced to claw their way back to the surface, from whence they are left to roam the streets in a mad, ignorant frenzy until such time as they do something worthwhile of note, at which point they are initiated into the Sabbat (if they survive that long).</p>
  <p align="justify"><b>Neonate:</b> A young member of kindred society by anyone's standards, neonate's are emancipated from their sires and as such are seen and treated as adults however the line between fledgling and neonate is incredibly subjective.</p>
  <p align="justify"><b>Ancilla:</b> Vampires with anything from a few decades to a few centuries of existence fall into the ancillae category. These kindred have paid their dues and largely understand the rules of society; they have also typically accomplished something of note by this point - of course, what that achievement might be is incredibly subjective and dependant on clan or sect standards.</p>
  <p align="justify"><b>Elder:</b> A vampire between 200 to 1000 years of age is considered one of the elders. They often have significant assets and established domains. Elders are usually the oldest active members in kindred society.</p>
  <p align="justify"><b>Methuselah:</b> Somewhere between 1000 - 2000 years of age, a profound change overtakes a vampire, whether this change is mystical or biological is not well understood. The weight of millenia and paranoia set in, pushing them to retreat from the world. Ever afraid of diablerie, they often fall into long bouts of torpor, mentally instructing their retainers through dreams and conditioning or else they keep their anonymity whilst actively engaging in kindred politics.</p>
  <p align="justify"><b>Antediluvian:</b> Those who came "before the flood", these are vampires of the Third Generation who are descended from Caine's original childer. Those antediluvian's who still live, live in a near perpetual torpor, across the centuries. Their powers and appetites are wholly terrifying, with the Sabbat believing that they will awaken at Gehenna and devour all younger generations of their kind to slack their thirst, thus they seek them out to destroy them.</p>
