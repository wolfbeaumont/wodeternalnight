<br>mother may i

<h3><b>THE OATH OF LILITH</b></h3>
<p><h4><b>EDITOR'S NOTE</b></h4>
Taken by a Ba’ham upon his initiation, the Oath is said to be a preservation of the words spoken by Lilith herself as she took up the Mantle of the Moon. Fantasy, I’m sure, but the words, when spoken, ring with a power that cannot be denied. Although I have never considered myself a formal Ba’ham, I take this oath each night as I arise. This devotion of mine may explain a few things….
<p>
<br>When first I tasted the fruit of the Trees
<br>felt the seeds of Life and Knowledge
<br>burn within me
<br>I swore that day that I would not turn back.
<br>When first I tasted the flesh of the kill
<br>felt the tang of the blood
<br>and the crunch of the bones
<br>I swore that day I would not die.
<br>When first I tasted my own blood
<br>felt the surge and the stir
<br>of my own life on my lips
<br>I swore that day to love myself
<br>above all.
<br>When first I tasted the light of the moon
<br>felt its glow in my womb
<br>and its wild tenderness
<br>I swore that day to walk in night.
<br>When first I tasted the love of a god
<br>felt the tearing rise
<br>of song and fire
<br>I swore on that day to cherish the flesh.
<br>When first I tasted the salt of the sea
<br>felt my blood become water
<br>as the sky fell behind me
<br>I swore that day to descend
<br>and to return with wonders.
<br>When first I tasted the love of a child
<br>screamed with the joy of the new life
<br>and wept for what I had lost and
<br>gained,
<br>I swore that day to nurture life
<br>as I had embraced death before.
<br>I swear by three times three times three
<br>That these seven moments shall remain
<br>my own
<br>And whatever may transpire
<br>No god nor man nor beast may take
<br>them from me.
<br>I swear by myself
<br>and my immortality.

  <h3><b>THE GENESIS FRAGMENT</b></h3>
<p><h4><b>EDITOR'S NOTES</b></h4>
<p>
This — the core of the Lilith myth cycle — is what’s missing from conventional scriptures.
<p>
Although it supposedly describes the First Days, the Judeo-Christian Genesis does not refer to Lilith at all. We find her mentioned in the Jewish Rabbinical Midrashim and several obscure (and not-so-obscure) Hebrew texts, but the consolidations of both the Christian Bible and the Jewish Tanakh finds the first woman absent.
<p>
When we look upon this “lost Genesis,” we can see why.
<p>
Despite its name, the so-called “Genesis Fragment” can’t actually be considered part of the canonical book of Jewish and Christian lore. Although the fragment’s earliest example is indeed written in Hebrew, the casual, occasionally even mocking portrayal of Jehovah (traditionally encrypted as YHVH, “The Lord,” or “The Holy One,” and followed by “blessed be He”) is so at odds with the ancient Jewish paradigm that the Fragment can be considered, at best, the work of a deeply heretical Israelite.
<p>
Not that there’s anything unusual in that: Genesis, Exodus and other early books declare the existence of myriad heretical or pagan sects among the children of Abraham; an author with a, shall we say, unconventional view of the Almighty is not hard to imagine. Still, many heretical writings were purged, along with their authors. The Genesis Fragment managed to make it into the writings smuggled from the Roman siege of Jerusalem (AD 64) and was somehow saved from destruction. Given the rather blasphemous nature of the Fragment, I doubt that it was ever considered part of the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses. More likely, it was kept as part of a protective charm or ritual — to “know thine enemy,” as it were — or as some keepsake or curio of a brave scholar. In any case, the Fragment was preserved from the fires of Rome’s legions, but left aside when the Torah was compiled from the salvaged writings — and again far later, when the Nicean Council consolidated the books of the Christian Bible.
<p>
For accuracy’s sake, I compared this Fragment against two similar ones, one in Greek, the other preserved in oral tradition through the Bahari rites. I was given access to a Ba’hara pictogram version, but since those designs are designed as mnemonics, not literal words, there could hardly be a “definitive” Bahari version. Partly for flavor’s sake, and partly to capture the rhythm of the Hebrew, I have used the Israelite version as the springboard for my translations. A series of footnotes record my own observations.
<p>
I couldn’t begin to claim which of these three versions is the “definitive” one. Each boasts its own authority. The Ba’hara account obviously functions as the Gospel According to Lilith; the Greek source serves as a “bridge” between the older scroll and the modern translation, and includes some intriguing pantheistic ambiguities; the heretical Israelite document fits in best with our Western conception of Scripture. Surprisingly, they all correspond disturbingly well.
<p>
While the Fragment boasts tantalizing Kabbalistic elements, they’re diffused and disjointed. Was the author a woman? If so, it would account for the incomplete correspondences and occasionally improvisational Hebrew. Feminine scholarship was frowned upon at best, and often forbidden — especially when that scholarship involved Scripture. Even young men were (and still are) kept away from the most sacred writings. I think the Fragment’s true source comes from “women’s lore” — the oral tradition passed between mother and daughter, and rarely written down. That’s certainly the case with the Ba’hara version. The similarities between all fragments lend weight to my assertion.
<p>
Despite its source and its importance to Bahari doctrine, the Fragment is more the story of the First Days than an account of Lilith’s trials. Lilith really isn’t the protagonist at all — that distinction belongs to Jehovah, the troubled, proud and ultimately tragic god whose hubris shatters the balance of Immortal Creation. All the same, his acts break a stranglehold of stasis, and create the first free-willed creature: Lilith. As she takes the stage, That Which Was falls to That Which Will Be. Her defiance — first of Jehovah, then of the elements, then of Lucifer and finally of the other gods — shakes up the happy little world that had harbored profound injustices. She brings love, joy, revelry and ultimately disaster, but emerges as the true architect of our world, for better and worse. When she departs for the Endless Sea to establish her own garden, we see Jehovah’s true equal: The woman who forced him to see the illusion he was hiding behind.
<p>
No wonder the Bahari consider her the True Goddess of our world.

  i: the creation
Once, all was silence and stillness. This was the Time of Nothing, when the
Ancient One rested Its eyes and moved not. Every 55,555 years, the Ancient One
breaks Its rest and opens Its eyes, to see what was not there before. Each 55,555 years,
It closes Its eyes, and all becomes silence and stillness again.1
Then the Ancient One opened Its eyes for the 333rd time, and a bolt of Light
split the darkness. 2 Thence came [Jehovah] 3 and the other Shining Ones. 4 To delight
the eyes of the Ancient One, they Spoke great Words and sang great Songs, and
thence wove the world into being.
Upon the shells of the 332 Old Worlds did they tread; and the creatures of
those worlds did howl and loose themselves upon the wilderness.5
Each of the host raised a garden and set itself to creating the plants and beasts
therein. Within each garden, the earth provided fettle for the growing things; and
the fire did burn in the skies by day and night; and the air did flow as words of
divinity; and the waters did nourish the flowers and plants and all living things.6
And Jehovah, the Firstborn, raised the greatest Garden of them all in the land
between the rivers. And He grew two Trees within that Garden, the Tree of Life and
the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. And each Tree bore fruit with sevenfold
seeds, and each seed carried the great truths of the Shining Ones.
In time, the beasts of Jehovah’s garden did fat themselves on the seeds of the
Trees, and came to know the great truths, but they cared not. They were naked, yet
they cared not. They were content, and cared not. The beasts fatted themselves upon
the seeds, and upon the grasses, and upon each other; for such is the Way of All
Things. And it was good.
But Jehovah hungered. He ate of the fruits of both Trees, but they did not fill
Him. He drank from the two rivers, and from the salt of the great seas, but they did
not fill Him. He feasted at the gardens of [Lucifer] and [Gabriel] and [Astarte]
and [Bes], but still He was not satisfied. His belly
thundered and the beasts hid in fear, so great was
the hunger of the Firstborn. But He hungered not
for meat, nor for fruit, nor for the company of His
cousins. Jehovah hungered for companionship.
So Jehovah mourned, and His moans
were like storms. He wept, and His tears
wetted the True Earth 7 at the center
of His Garden. And they fell
upon the seeds from the Trees of
Life and Knowledge, and they
did bring forth wondrous,
strange fruit.
Male and Female
rose as One from the
mud of the True Earth,
joined back to back;
and they struggled to
stand and could not.
Until Jehovah passed
His hand between them
and made them Two; equal
and strong He made Them.
And the Ancient One saw
this not. But seemed It to smile
nonetheless.
