  <h1><h2><b><u>CAINITE NATURE ARCHETYPES</u></b></h2></h1>
  <h2><h2><b>Table of Contents</b></h2></h2>
  <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#1.1">1.1 Introduction</a><br></h3>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1">1.1 Introduction</a></b></h2>
  <p align="justify">At the Storyteller’s option, a particularly successful achievement of this nature may yield multiple Willpower points, but unless otherwise stated by them, assume only 1 point.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.1">1.1.1 Anarchist</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Anarchist believes that the world would be a better place if every individual took responsibility for their own destiny and stayed out of everyone else’s business. They live their own rules and refuse to bend to higher powers or society.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you reject unnecessary rules, laws, or social norms and achieve success because of it.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.2">1.1.2 Architect</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Architect has a sense of purpose even greater than themselves. They are truly happy only when creating something of lasting value for others. People will always need things, and the Architect strives to provide at least one necessity. Inventors, pioneers, town founders, entrepreneurs, and the like are all Architect Archetypes. A Cainite Architect might seek to create new laws that affect their fellow undead, or they might aim to establish a new Anarch domain.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you establish something of importance or lasting value.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.3">1.1.3 Autocrat</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Autocrat wants to be in charge. They seek prominence for its own sake, not because they have an operation’s best interests at heart or because they have the best ideas (though they may certainly think so). They may genuinely believe others are incompetent, but ultimately they crave power and control. Dictators, gang leaders, bullies, corporate raiders, and their ilk are Autocrat Archetypes. A Cainite Autocrat may crave a title, or they may wish to be recognized as the leader of a coterie.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower when you achieve control over a group or organization involving other individuals.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.4">1.1.4 Bon Vivant</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Bon Vivant knows that life — and unlife — is shallow and meaningless. As such, they decide to enjoy their time on Earth. The Bon Vivant is not necessarily irresponsible. Rather, they are simply predisposed to having a good time along the way. Most Bon Vivants have low Self-Control ratings, as they are so given to excess. Hedonists, sybarites, and dilettantes are all examples of the Bon Vivant Archetype. A Cainite Bon Vivant may sire a brood of fawning childer, or they may spend their time gorging on the blood of drug abusers for the contact high.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you truly enjoy yourself and can fully express your exultation.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.5">1.1.5 Bravo</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Bravo is a tough and a bully, and often takes perverse pleasure in tormenting the weak. To the Bravo’s mind, might makes right. Power is what matters, and only those with power should be respected. Naturally, physical power is the best kind, but any kind will do. The Bravo sees overt threats as a perfectly reasonable means of gaining cooperation. The Bravo is not incapable of pity or kindness; they just prefer to do things their way. Robbers, bigots, and thugs are all Bravo Archetypes. A Cainite Bravo may abuse authority the system has granted them, or they may — violently or otherwise — force other Cainites out of their way to get what they want. They are almost certainly an asshole.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower any time you achieve your agenda through brutishness or intimidation. This need not be physical, as many Bravos verbally or socially cow their victims.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.6">1.1.6 Capitalist</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">They are the ultimate mercenary, realizing that there is always a market to be developed — anything can be a commodity. They have a keen understanding of how to manipulate both kine and Cainites into thinking that they need specific goods or services. Appearance and influence are everything when it comes to the big sale, though they’ll use anything to their advantage. Sales, men, soldiers of fortune, and bootlickers all adhere to the Capitalist Archetype.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you make a successful “sale” of any commodity. Commodities need not be physical items; they may be bits of information, favors, or other intangibles.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.7">1.1.7 Caregiver</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. A Caregiver takes their comfort in consoling others, and people often come to them with their problems. Cainites with Caregiver Archetypes often attempt, as best they can, to protect the mortals on whom they feed. Nurses, doctors, and psychiatrists are examples of potential Caregivers. Caregiver Cainites are often the type who — tragically — Embrace mortal loves they’ve left behind in hopes of softening their loss, or even those who create situations of grief in order to ease it and thus validate themselves.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you successfully protect or nurture someone else.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.8">1.1.8 Celebrant</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Celebrant takes joy in their cause. Whether the character’s passion is battle, religion, foiling their rivals, or reading fine literature, it gives the Celebrant the strength to withstand adversity. Given the chance, the Celebrant will indulge in their passion as deeply as possible. Unlike the Fanatic, the Celebrant pursues their cause not out of duty, but out of enthusiasm. Crusaders, hippies, political activists, and art enthusiasts are Celebrant Archetypes. Celebrant Cainite may cleave to mortal ideologies that are incongruous with their new Damned conditions, or they may be the advocates of new trends and causes that move through undead society.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you pursue your cause or convert another character to the same passion. Conversely, lose a point of temporary Willpower whenever you are denied your passion or it is badly lost to you.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.9">1.1.9 Chameleon</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Independent and self-reliant, they carefully study the behavior and mannerisms of everyone they come in contact with so they can pass themselves off as someone else later. They spend so much time altering their mannerisms and appearance that their own sire may not even recognize them. Spies, con artists, drag queens, and impostors best represent the Chameleon.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you fool someone into thinking you’re someone else for your own (or your pack or coterie‘s) benefit.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.10">1.1.10 Child</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Child is still immature in personality and temperament. They want what they want now, and often prefer someone to give it to them. Although they can typically care for themselves, they would rather have someone cater to their capricious desires. Some Child Archetypes are actually innocent rather than immature, ignorant of the cold ways of the real world. Actual children, spoiled individuals, and some drug abusers are Child Archetypes. Cainites with the Child Archetype might have not yet fully have reached an understanding of the world and have some characteristic such as cruelty, entitlement, sympathy, or hunger that is out of balance with their other personality aspects, as they haven’t yet reached the “rounded” state of adulthood. Note that a Child Archetype need not be a physical, literal child at the time of Embrace. Some people simply never grow up.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you manage to convince someone to help you with no gain to themselves, or to nurture you.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.11">1.1.11 Competitor</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Competitor takes great excitement in the pursuit of victory. To the Competitor, every task is a new challenge to meet and a new contest to win. Indeed, the Competitor sees all interactions as some sort of opportunity for them to be the best — the best leader, the most productive, the most valuable, or whatever. Corporate raiders, professional athletes, and impassioned researchers are all examples of Competitor Archetypes. Cainite Competitors have any number of resources and accomplishments over which to assert themselves, from mortal herds and creature comforts to titles and prestige in Kindred society.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain one point of Willpower whenever you succeed at a test or challenge. Note that a test or challenge is more than just a dice roll; it’s an entire dramatic situation.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.12">1.1.12 Conformist</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Conformist is a follower, taking another’s lead and finding security in the decisions of others. They prefer not to take charge, instead seeking to throw in with the rest of the group and lend their own unique aid. The Conformist is drawn to the most dynamic personality or the individual they perceive to be the “best.” Being a Conformist is not necessarily a bad thing — every group needs followers to lend stability to their causes. Groupies, party voters, and “the masses” are Conformist Archetypes. Conformist Kindred can take many forms, from the ardent Sabbat pack member, to the Cainite who follows a Clan-first agenda, to the trusted supporters of a titled Cainite or a rising star.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever the group or your supported leader achieves a goal due to your support.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.13">1.1.13 Conniver</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Why work for something when you can trick somebody else into getting it for you? The Conniver always tries to find the easy way, the fast track to success and wealth. Some people call them a thief, a swindler, or less pleasant terms, but they know that everybody in the world would do unto them if they could. They just do it first, and better. Criminals, con artists, salespeople, urchins, and entrepreneurs might be Connivers. Some would argue that all Cainites are Connivers in some sense, but those that have the Conniver archetype may be abusive to their childer and ghouls, or they may be more persuasive in gaining support for their machinations.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you trick someone into doing something for you, or when you convince someone to help you against their own best interests.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.14">1.1.14 Creep Show</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">They strive to shock and disgust those around them with gratuitous acts and ostentatiously “evil” mannerisms. They realize, of course, that it’s all show and merely a way to intimidate and control others. Outsiders, on the other hand, think they are the Devil incarnate, and they revel in this image. Shock-rockers, rebellious teenagers, circus freaks, and the attention-starved exemplify the Creep Show Archetype.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone recoils from you in horror or otherwise reacts in fear.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.15">1.1.15 Critic</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Critic observes the world around them with a jaundiced eye, seeking out flaws and deficiencies. They experience a special satisfaction in exploiting these weaknesses publically so that eventually the design will improve. Some critics feel it is their duty to push the world to be better.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you find a flaw in a design or plan and then improve upon it.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.16">1.1.16 Curmudgeon</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">A Curmudgeon is bitter and cynical, finding flaws in everything and seeing little humor in life or unlife. They are often fatalistic or pessimistic, and have very little esteem for others. To the Curmudgeon, the glass is never more than half-full, though it may be damn near empty when other people are involved. Many Internet junkies, pop-culture fans, and Generation Xers are Curmudgeons. Cainite Curmudgeons see elder oppression or spoiled neonates running amok behind every development in undead society, and may or may not rise beyond acerbic grumbling to change any problems they perceive.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone does something specific and negative, just like you said they would. You must predict and quantify this failure aloud, such as by warning, “The Prince is going to fuck us on this one,” or “Just watch, that Malkavian’s ghoul is going to do something really reckless.” You may simply whisper your prophecy of grief to the Storyteller if you wish, instead of announcing it to the whole troupe.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.17">1.1.17 Dabbler</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Dabbler is interested in everything but focuses on nothing. They flit from idea to idea, passion to passion, and project to project without actually finishing anything. Others may get swept up in the Dabbler’s enthusiasm, and be left high and dry when they move on to something else without warning. Most Dabblers have high Intelligence, Charisma, and Manipulation ratings, but not much in the way of Wits or Stamina. Toreador are often Dabblers, particularly those afflicted with the derisive sobriquet “Poseurs.”</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain Willpower whenever you find a new enthusiasm and drop your old one completely.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.18">1.1.18 Deviant</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Deviant is a freak, ostracized from society by unique tastes or beliefs that place them outside the mainstream. Deviants are not indolent rebels or shiftless “unrecognized geniuses”; rather, they are independent thinkers who don’t quite fit in the status quo. Deviant Archetypes often feel that the world stands against them, and as such reject traditional morality. Some have bizarre tastes, preferences, and ideologies. Extremists, eccentric celebrities, and straight-up weirdoes are Deviant Archetypes. Cainite deviants may observe heretical or outlawed habits like diablerie or deference to elders, and they may well go Anarch or Autarkis instead of having to constantly defend their subversion of Traditions or Sect customs.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower any time you are able to flout social norms without retribution.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.19">1.1.19 Director</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">To the Director, nothing is worse than chaos and disorder. The Director seeks to be in charge, adopting a “my way or the highway” attitude on matters of decision-making. The Director is more concerned with bringing order out of strife, however, and need not be truly “in control” of a group to guide it. Coaches, teachers, and many political figures exemplify the Director Archetype. Cainite Directors may be simple advocates of established codes, or they may prove instrumental in tearing down corrupt existing orders to make way for new leaders or factional movements.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower when you influence or aid a group or influential individual in the completion of a difficult task.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.20">1.1.20 Enigma</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Their actions are bizarre, puzzling, and inexplicable to everyone except themselves. Their strangeness may be a residual effect from their Embrace, or the most effective way for them to carry out their work. To the rest of the world, however, their erratic actions suggest that they’re eccentric if not completely crazy. Conspiracy theorists, deep-cover agents, and Jyhad fanatics all live up to the Enigma Archetype.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone is completely perplexed or baffled by one of your actions that later turns out to be a fruitful endeavor.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.21">1.1.21 Eye of the Storm</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Despite their calm appearance, chaos and havoc seems to follow them. From burning cities to emotional upheaval, death and destruction circle them like albatrosses. For their, unlife is a never-ending trial with uncertainty around every corner. Gang leaders, political figures, and other influential individuals exemplify the Eye of the Storm Archetype.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever a ruckus, riot, or less violent but equally chaotic phenomenon occurs around you.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.22">1.1.22 Fanatic</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Fanatic has a purpose, and that purpose consumes their existence. The Fanatic pours themselves into their cause, and they may even feel guilty for undertaking any objective that deviates from their higher goal. To the Fanatic, the end justifies the means — the cause is more important than those who serve it. Players who choose Fanatic Archetypes must select a cause for their character to further. Revolutionaries, zealots, and sincere firebrands are all examples of Fanatic Archetypes. Cainite Fanatics are often champions for or against a particular aspect of undead society, such as equality among all Cainites, the extermination of Anarchs, or stamping infernalism out of the Sword of Caine.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish some task that directly relates to your cause.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.23">1.1.23 Gallant</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Gallants are flamboyant souls, always seeking attention and the chance to be the brightest star. Gallants seek the company of others, if only to earn their adoration. Attention drives the Gallant, and the chase is often as important as its end. Nothing excites a Gallant so much as a new audience to woo. Performers, only children, and those with low self-esteem often embody the Gallant Archetype. Cainite Gallants may be Harpies, or they may have enormous herds of doting thralls.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a Willpower point whenever you successfully impress another person.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.24">1.1.24 Guru</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Their enlightenment draws others to them. They may be a mentor of a particular Path of Enlightenment, a priest with the Church, or merely an idealist. Whatever the case, their presence motivates and moves others to engage in spiritual or ideological pursuits. Their peers view them as calm, centered, and “with it,” even when they are preaching violence as a means to an end. Cult leaders, Zen masters, and Pack Priests are examples of Gurus.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone seeks out your help in spiritual matters and your guidance moves that individual to an enlightened action that he normally would not have taken. Also, regain a point of Willpower whenever you achieve an epiphany that relates to your personal philosophy.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.25">1.1.25 Idealist</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Idealist believes — truly, madly, deeply — in some higher goal or morality. The object of their idealism may be something as pragmatic as the Camarilla’s eventual triumph or as amorphous as the ultimate good, but the belief is there. Idealists are frequently either very new to the Blood or very old, and many seek Golconda as the final expression of their idealism. In the meantime, an Idealist tries to reconcile their beliefs with the demands of Cainite existence, often acting contrary to their self-interest in doing so.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower any time an action in pursuit of your ideals furthers your goals and brings your ideal closer to fruition.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.26">1.1.26 Judge</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Judge perpetually seeks to improve the system. A Judge takes pleasure in their rational nature and ability to draw the right conclusion when presented with facts. The Judge respects justice, as it is the most efficient model for resolving issues. Judges, while they pursue the “streamlining” of problems, are rarely visionary, as they prefer proven models to insight. Engineers, lawyers, and doctors are often Judge Archetypes. Kindred Judges might gravitate toward enforcement roles in local society, or they might be a voice of reason in an otherwise radical coterie.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you correctly solve a problem by considering the evidence presented, or when one of your arguments unites dissenting parties.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.27">1.1.27 Loner</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Even in a crowd the Loner sticks out, because they so obviously do not belong. Others view Loners as pariahs, remote, and isolated, but in truth the Loner prefers their own company to that of others. For whatever reason, the Loner simply disdains others, and this feeling is often reciprocated. Criminals, radicals, and free thinkers are all Loner Archetypes. Cainite Loners often hail from one of the rugged individualist Clans like the Gangrel or Ravnos, and they have a proclivity for ending up Autarkis by dint of not giving a shit what some up-his-own-ass Prince or Archbishop says is a law.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower when you accomplish something by yourself, yet which still benefits the coterie in some way.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.28">1.1.28 Martyr</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Martyr suffers for their cause, enduring their trials out of the belief that their discomfort will ultimately improve others’ lot. Some Martyrs simply want the attention or sympathy their ordeals engender, while others are sincere in their cause, greeting their opposition with unfaltering faith. Many revolutionaries, staunch idealists, and outcasts are Martyr Archetypes. Cainite Martyrs are often associated with reform movements among Kindred society, but rarely as figureheads — and they need not necessarily be on the pro-reform side of the issue.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower when you suffer some amount of damage or loss of a definable resource for your ideals or another’s immediate gain.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.29 ">1.1.29 Masochist</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Masochist exists to test their limits, to see how much pain they can tolerate before they collapse. They gain satisfaction in humiliation, suffering, denial, and even physical pain. The Masochist defines who they are by their capacity to feel discomfort — they rise each night only to greet a new pain. Certain extreme athletes, urban tribalists, and the clinically depressed exemplify the Masochist Archetype. Cainite Masochists might be overtly self-mortifying horrors who play to their Beast’s self-destructive whims, or they may be ambitious taskmasters, as with a coterie leader who refuses to accept failure and pushes his own limits in his exacting schemes.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain one point of Willpower when your own suffering leads to some tangible gain for you.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.30">1.1.30 Monster</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Monster knows they are a creature of darkness and acts like it. Evil and suffering are the Monster’s tools, and they use them wherever they go. No villainy is below them, no hurt goes uninflicted, and no lie remains untold. The Monster does not commit evil for its own sake, but rather as a means to understand what they have become. Unstable individuals, those who have been greatly wronged or harmed, and those defined as sociopaths may come to display characteristics of the Monster Archetype. Cainite Monsters include many Sabbat, degenerate Cainite elders, and those who never adjust properly to what they have become after the Embrace.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Malignant deeds reinforce the Monster’s sense of purpose. Monster characters should pick a specific atrocity, regaining Willpower whenever they indulge that urge. For example, a tempter regains Willpower for luring someone into wickedness, while an apostate earns back Willpower for causing another to doubt her faith. Pick a destiny and fulfill it.</i></p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Storytellers, be careful with how you reward this Archetype. For example, a player who chooses violence as an atrocity shouldn’t recoup Willpower in every combat, but perhaps only in those that involve wanton destruction, or even cause degeneration checks due to their gruesomeness. Monster is a difficult Archetype for which to offer rewards, and those rewards should come as a result of the character challenging his own descent into the Beast, not rampaging ungovernably because he gains an ever refreshing pool of bonus dice.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.31">1.1.31 Nihilist</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Nihilist believes that life is without objective purpose or intrinsic value. Since nothing matters, the Nihilist feels morally free to indulge in whatever destructive passions they might crave at the moment.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you engage in self-destructive behavior.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.32">1.1.32 Pedagogue</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Pedagogue knows it all, and desperately wants to inform others. Whether through a sense of purpose or a genuine desire to help others, the Pedagogue makes sure their message is heard — at length, if necessary. Pedagogue Archetypes may range from well-meaning mentors to verbose blowhards who love to hear themselves talk. Instructors, the overeducated, and “veterans of their field” are all examples of Pedagogue Archetypes. Cainite Pedagogues include watchdogs of the Traditions, ideological Anarchs, and perhaps even that rare soul seeking Golconda who wants company on the journey.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain one point of Willpower whenever you see or learn of someone who has benefited from the wisdom you shared with them.</i></p></span>

  <h2><b><a id="1.1.33">1.1.33 Penitent</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Penitent exists to atone for the grave sin they commit simply by being who they are. Penitents have either low self-esteem or traumatic past experiences, and feel compelled to “make up” for inflicting themselves upon the world. Penitent Archetypes are not always religious in outlook; some truly want to scourge the world of the grief they bring to it. Repentant sinners, persons with low self-esteem, and remorseful criminals are examples of the Penitent Archetype. Penitent Cainite include those who scourge themselves of the Beast like medieval monks, Cainites who stand up for the rights of mortals, and those who subsist entirely on the vitae of animals.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you feel that you have achieved absolution for a given grievance. This redemption should be of the same magnitude as the transgression — the greater the crime, the greater the penance. The Storyteller is the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes a reasonable act of reparation.</i></p></span>

  <h2><b><a id="1.1.34">1.1.34 Perfectionist</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Perfectionist Archetypes demand flawless execution. A half-hearted job gives the Perfectionist no satisfaction, and they expect the same degree of commitment and attention to detail from others that they demand from themselves. Although the Perfectionist may be exacting, the achievement of the end goal drives them, and often those for whom they are responsible. Prima donnas, artists, and architects exemplify the Perfectionist Archetype. A Perfectionist Cainite might be a zealous Sabbat member who expects more than his pack can consistently deliver, or she may be a moralist who sometimes applies her own high standards of Humanity to others in her coterie.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish your goal without any demonstrable flaw or impediment, and regain a Willpower point whenever you motivate another character to succeed as a result of your own shining example.</i></p></span>
  <hr>
  <h2><b><a id="1.1.35">1.1.35 Rebel</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">The Rebel is a malcontent, never satisfied with the status quo or the system as it is. They hate the very idea of authority and do everything in their power to challenge and undermine it. Perhaps the Rebel truly believes in their ideals, but it is just as likely that they bear authority figures some ill will over a “wrong” done to them in the past. A Rebel may hate institutions categorically, or they may be consumed with opposition toward a single particular authority. Teenagers, insurrectionists, and nonconformists all exemplify the Rebel Archetype. Rebel Cainites certainly include the Sabbat, Anarchs, and temperamental Brujah, but also have room for Tremere who chafe at the rigid Clan hierarchy or neonates who deplore their sires.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower whenever your actions adversely affect your chosen opposition. Rebels may oppose the government, the Church, a Cainite Prince, or any other holder of authority. The player should choose whom or what his character rebels against when he adopts this Archetype. Storytellers should take rebellion against “all authority” with a grain of salt, and apply the Willpower reward for such a broad concept to only greater and greater actions of insurgency.</i></p></span>

  <h2><b><a id="1.1.36">1.1.36 Rogue</a></b></h2>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify">Only one thing matters to the Rogue: themselves. To each their own, and if others cannot protect their claims, they have no right to them. The Rogue is not necessarily a thug or bully, however. They simply refuse to succumb to the whims of others. Rogues almost universally possess a sense of self-sufficiency. They have their own best interests in mind at all times. Prostitutes, capitalists, and criminals all embody the Rogue Archetype. Cainite Rogues include diablerists, Autarkis, and a Primogen who puts his Clan’s opportunities before the supremacy of the Cainite as a whole.</p></span>
  <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block"><p align="justify"><i>Regain a point of Willpower when your self-centered disposition leads you to profit, materially or otherwise. At the Storyteller’s discretion, accumulating gain without exposing your own weaknesses may let you regain more points of Willpower. As well, you may regain a point of Willpower when your efforts benefit the group to which you belong when that benefit comes at the expense of another group.</i></p></span>
