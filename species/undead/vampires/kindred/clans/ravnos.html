  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Should a <a href="https://www.wodeternalnight.wiki/species/humans/daennos.html">Daennosi</a> ever be turned into a shilmulo, they will lose all connection to the Blood of Daenna. They will be stripped of their blood affinities, unless they become one of the Ravnos, in which case their powers will become dormant, awoken only by the consumption of those Daennos with said powers. Whilst other vampires may manifest these abilities, they would be uncontrollable, the Ravnos by comparison still have their memories, the knowledge of how to use the Blood of Daenna.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2"><font size="2">Becoming one of the Shilmulo is deeply traumatic for a Daennosi with losing their connection to the Blood but especially so for any with magical abilities. For a Ravnos vampire, this is another reason they stay close to their family, to be able to retain that connection to the blood by feeding. Other families will do everything in their power to prevent themselves becoming part of a “Daennosi Herd”. The Ravnos will typically only embrace those from their Ravnos Daennosi family, or the wider Daennosi community; it is highly unusual for a non-Daennosi to be embraced by the Ravnos.</font></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2"><font size="2"><font><font size="2">A Ravnos vampire may only use their previously mortal Daennosi Blood Affinities whilst Daennosi blood is in their body. It costs one blood point to activate a nascent power. Once activated, the blood ability is active for the remaining scene. Blood points drunk from a Daennosi are used normally by a vampire, the character may not hoard the Daennosi blood points for use in activating their blood affinities. Blood points are used in the order they are acquired.</font></font></font></font></p>
