<b>The First Tradition:
The Masquerade</b><br>
<i>Thou shall not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood.
Doing such shall renounce thy claims of Blood.</i>
<b>The Second Tradition:
The Domain</b><br>
<i>Thy domain is thine own concern.
All others owe thee respect while in it.
None may challenge thy word while in thy domain.</i>
<b>The Third Tradition:
The Progeny</b><br>
<i>Thou shall only Sire another with the permission of thine Elder.
If thou createst another without thine Elder’s leave, both thou and thy Progeny shall be slain.</i>
<b>The Fourth Tradition:
The Accounting</b><br>
<i>Those thou create are thine own children.
Until thy Progeny shall be Released, thou shall command them in all things.
Their sins are thine to endure.</i>
<b>The Fifth Tradition:
Hospitality</b><br>
<i>Honor one another’s domain.
When thou comest to a foreign city, thou shall present thyself to the one who ruleth there.
Without the word of acceptance, thou art nothing.</i>
<b>The Sixth Tradition:
Destruction</b><br>
<i>Thou art forbidden to destroy another of thy kind.
The right of destruction belongeth only to thine Elder.
Only the Eldest among thee shall call the Blood Hunt.</i>
