<p align="justify">All Daennos begin with one point in Blood Purity. Additional points of Blood Purity can only be gained by spending freebie points at character creation. Blood Purity reflects a Daennosi's connection to the Blood of Deanna, mother of all the Daennos. Typically, a full-blooded Daennosi would have a higher Blood Purity score, but it is possible that even with one parent of Daennosi blood a character can have such a score, due to a more intense connection with the magic inside them, compared to a less in-tune full-blooded Daennosi. However, it is rare for a Daennosi of less than one-quarter "pure" blood (descended from Daenna) to have a Blood Purity higher than a score of two.<p>
It is the Blood that makes the Daennos what they are. Blood Purity is valued amongst them however its most important effect is on the magical abilities and Blood Affinities it offers. Even Daennosi players with no magical powers value Blood Purity highly for the number of Blood Purity dice added to all rolls when using any Blood Affinities. Their Blood also grants any Daennos group power whereby the Daennos are sometimes able to aid their fellows through the strength of their Blood. The more powerful an individual Daennosi's Blood, the more help they are in such workings. Blood Purity also limits the number of Blood Affinities a Daennosi can attain. A Daennosi may only have a number of Blood Affinities equal to their Blood Purity score. Blood Purity can be increased over time as a result of honing a character's connection to their heritage, thereby learning another Blood Affinity.<p>
The only issue with a high Blood Purity score is that the gaje become more uncomfortable around the character, due to their sensing of the Blood's power. Such aversion may manifest in several ways from avoidance to outright hatred or even murder. The reaction will depend on circumstances and individuals involved.</p>
