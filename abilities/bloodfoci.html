  <h2><font size="3"><b><a id="intro"></a>1.1 Introduction</b></font></h2><p align="justify"><font size="2">An innate talent of the <a href="https://www.wodeternalnight.wiki/species/humans/daennos.html">Daennos</a> alone, they have the ability to combine the magic of their blood, channelling it into a single individual. To temporarily increase that person’s capabilities in a moment of dire need. In order to do this, each member of the group must shed their blood onto an object the recipient will carry with them. The recipient must shed their own blood, in turn, onto the object, last of all.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2">Each participant in the Blood Foci spends one point of willpower when they add even just a few drops of their blood to the focal object. The Blood Foci will then improve a single blood affinity of the  recipient’s choice, for the duration of the scene.. How much the recipient’s blood affinity is improved depends on the combined number of blood purity dots the group of Daennos participating in the blood foci possess., including the recipient. For every three dots of blood purity the group possesses, the recipient using the focus gains an automatic success for that scene.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="2">The recipient can choose when to spend their automatic blood foci successes during a scene, but must declare the number of automatic successes used before each roll.</font></p>
<span style="padding-left: 40px; display:block"><p align="justify"><font size="2">1-3 Blood Purity Points = 1 Automatic Success<br>
4-6 Blood Purity Points = 2 Automatic Successes<br>
7-9 Blood Purity Points = 3 Automatic Successes<br>
10-12 Blood Purity Points = 4 Automatic Successes<br>
13-15 Blood Purity Points = 5 Automatic Successes</font></p></span>
<p align="justify"><font size="2">The potential of the Blood Foci is truly impressive, however it must be used before the blood dries, meaning the blood affinity chosen must be performed within the space of fifteen minutes once the group have completed shedding their blood.</font></p>
