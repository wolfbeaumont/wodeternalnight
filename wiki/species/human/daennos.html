  <h2><font size="3"><b><a id="introduction"></a>1.1 Introduction</b></font></h2>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">The Daennos are typically human characters who are essentially the wildcards of fate. They appear at important moments in history, becoming catalysts for change. They have close ties with many of the supernatural and are a good background for <a href="https://wodeternalnight.jcink.net/index.php?act=Pages&pid=5">Ravnos</a> vampires or <a href="https://wodeternalnight.jcink.net/index.php?act=Pages&pid=27">Silent Strider</a> werewolves.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Outcasts in the mortal world, they wander between cities and countries in their own world, only interacting with Gaje when there is something of benefit for them to gain. They are called the Daennos, or Daennosi in singular form. Historically they have ties with the Romani of the old world, having borrowed heavily from their languages and cultural practices, in part, however they are not an ethnicity per se, having descended from one common ancestor they have since spread out and permeated every race and ethnicity with their bloodline and they typically function as a "found" community, of sorts. As the Blood of their common ancestor dilutes over the milennia, it awakens less and less, but for those that it does - it is transformative. These people find themselves to be restless, yearning for the open road, repelled by large urban locales. In the old days, this aligned them with the Romani cultures of eastern Europe but since the 20th century they have become more comparable to the quinnessential vagabond homeless, wandering the world in their cars, jumping trains etc. moving from enclave to enclave of homeless communities both within and outside of typical urban centres. It is within these communities that the Daennos find one another, drawn as they are to the Blood of their own, with whom they share the oral history and magic of their ancestors.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">The Daennos believe they have a destiny and are protected by fate itself and rarely if ever give up the secret workings of their ways to outsiders. They prefer to travel, despite pressures from the gaje to "get off the streets" and whilst some do, the Daennos tend to return to their travels sooner or later, especially the younger generations.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">The Daennos came about with the exodus of Daenna from the Ivory City, thousands of years ago, when she was secreted away with the last remaining seeds of the Tree of Knowledge, which her husband had created - the fruit of which gave Daenna's blood and the blood of all Daennos descended from her, great power. The fruit was made to remove Daenna’s husband’s constant thirst for blood, for he was a Shilmulo. He believed it would also give him greater powers still. But they were betrayed and parted ever after. It is the blood of Daenna that makes the gaje distrust or hate the Daennos, as they are able to subconsciously sense a Daennosi’s unnatural otherness.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">The Daennos come from every and any background, their Blood potentially awakening at any moment, pulling them out of an otherwise rooted existence. For this reason they have always found solace amongst the homeless, drawn into the vagabond lifestyle of the open road. Despite their myriad origins, and some are even born into the nomadic community, the Daennosi do have families of an adopted sort, which any newly "awoken" Daennosi may be invited to join.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Over the centuries the Daennosi families have fought more and more, but they always consider each other with respect unlike the gaje. In the end, Daennosi are all family, alone against the world. There has been no single leader of the Daennos since Daenna first brought them into the world but the head of each family within each community is called the daebaro (male) or daebara (female), and the many leaders within each family often stay in contact with each other. Whether born or adopted into one of the families, it is traditional to take their name, and marriage within the family is common, given the diaspora of their gene pool.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Much of the knowledge about the Daennos' true origins has been lost over the centuries with only a few of their people truly knowing much about their past, and the supernatural at large. In fact, the purer the bloodline, the more innately aware of their power they are and more accepting of the world of darkness..</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">There are many Daennosi families ranging in size from as little as twenty people to a few thousand. The families are resourceful, creative, brave and ingenious. They are not materialists by nature, scavenging, recycling or making what they need, living in the present and not worrying about tomorrow or holding onto wealth.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">As well as the magic of Daenna’s blood, she also passed on the seeds of the Tree of Knowledge to her great-granddaughter Evania, Daenna said there would come a time when the guardians of these seeds would know how they were to be used. Many Daennos who know of the seeds believe this will happen in the coming Convergence, a changing of the ages, when the five seeds will be reunited and split open to form the second Tree of Knowledge and reunify the spirit and body of the world which were falsely split apart aeons ago.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Legends say that one seed each is held by each of the five great families, though by whom is unknown, if the stories are true at all. Though rumours persist that the Tsurara Family are hunting down all the guardians of the seeds so that they can reunite them themselves, and affect the outcome of the Convergence. And thereby control the destiny of the world.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Many Daennos believe the Tsurara family to be marhime (impure) due to their violent nature but the Tsurara believe the time has passed for the other families and that they are the sharp blade of the Daennos’ destiny.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">In general, the Daennos families intermingle, within their enclaves or on the open road, but smaller communities tend to only host one or two permenant families within the communities. The Daennos are often simply mistaken for the typically homeless and treated thus.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">It is believed some mages are aware of the seeds as are the <a href="https://wodeternalnight.jcink.net/index.php?act=Pages&pid=28">Inconnu</a> vampire clan. But it is said the seeds are too dangerous for anyone but a Daennosi to touch, for those without the Blood would be cursed..</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">The Daennos in particular, are about cleansing themselves, and to become forever contaminated is considered an awful curse. A Daennosi will always cleanse themselves ritually before returning to family from a time away. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://wodeternalnight.jcink.net/index.php?act=Pages&amp;pid=29">Gangrel</a> vampires are said to watch over and sometimes protect the Daennos in their territories, due to an ancient agreement between their two peoples, after a Daennosi rescued one of their elders, selflessly.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">When initiated into one of the families, an initiate is sometimes claimed by one of the elements in a "birth reading". If this happens they are thereafter trained in compatible skills. Some Daennos have their Blood awoken early in life, with the Phuri Dae only accepting such children into their family, where they are purposefully tested for magical attunement with the elements. The Daennos can have other powers such as telekinesis or astral travelling but these are not as a result of the Blood and thus they cannot be enhanced by a gathering of the Daennos.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Should a Daennosi ever be turned into a shilmulo, they will lose all connection to the Blood of Daenna. They will be stripped of their blood affinities, unless they become one of the Ravnos, in which case their powers will become dormant, awoken only by the consumption of Daennosi blood. Whilst other vampires may manifest these abilities, upon consuming the Blood, they would be uncontrollable, the Ravnos by comparison still have their memories, the knowledge of how to use the Blood of Daenna.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Becoming one of the Shilmulo is deeply traumatic for a Daennosi, as they lose their connection to the Blood, but it is especially so for any with magical abilities. For a Ravnos vampire, this is another reason they stay close to their family, to be able to retain that connection to the Blood by feeding. Other families will do everything in their power to prevent themselves from becoming part of a “Daennosi Herd”. They also protect them from the predation of <a href="https://wodeternalnight.jcink.net/index.php?act=Pages&amp;pid=30">Nosferatu</a> and Gangrel vampires, as they pass through cities and the open road alike.</font></p>
