  <p align="justify"><font size="2">The 1999 World of Darkness: Gypsy sourcebook is problematic for a number of culturally discriminatory reasons, as society evolves. And whilst that is commendable, I did not simply wish to abandon a piece of the puzzle that is the oWoD traditional canon. Instead, I am making a continuing effort to redefine the source material into a group distinct from the Romani cultures and ethnicities. This begins with a new name, the Daennos, named for the mother of their people - Daenna, whose empowered blood they carry after she ate from the Tree of Knowledge.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Whilst I want to keep the nomadic aspect of the source material, there are much more interesting ways to go about it, such as homeless individuals who are inexplicitably drawn to one another, forming communities that typically enclave within larger homeless communities. In this way, the Ravnos who are a clan of vampires descended from Daenna, are distinct from the Nosferatu who prey upon the urban homeless, because the Daennosi tend to avoid cities, preferring to be on the road or visiting homeless communities in the wilderness. As such the Ravnos fall somewhere between the Nosferatu and the Gangrel.
